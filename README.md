# CryptoClustering

Python and unsupervised learning was used to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. 

Challenge requirement consisted of:

(•) Find the Best Value for k Using the Scaled DataFrame
(•) Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Scaled DataFrame
(•) Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
(•) Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA DataFrame
(•) Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA DataFrame
(•) Visualize and Compare the Results
